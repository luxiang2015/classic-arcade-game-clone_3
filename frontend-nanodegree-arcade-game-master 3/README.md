Instructions:

Open the index.html file in chrome. You will see a player at the bottom of the picture.
Use the arrow keys to move the player around. Try to avoid hitting the water and the bugs which are moving from left to right at different speed randomly. 
If the player hit the water or the bug, it will be placed back to the original position.
